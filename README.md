# Madlibs-game

## Funny and simple game created using C#

### Description:

This was my first ever project in C# using a console application. I learnt how to use text in the console and I understood how to take user input and change it so that it returns it back on the screen. This project I followed it on YouTube to put my knowledge to the test and understand how a project is made.

I also learnt how to play around with the background colours and understand different types of properties and how the data structures work.

### What I learnt:
- Console app
- User input
- Variables



### Constraints:

None.

### Improvements:

None.
