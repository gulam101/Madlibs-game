### Description:

This was my first ever project in C# using a console application. I learnt how to write text in the console, and I understood how to take user input and change it so that it returns it back on the screen. I also had some knowledge built up from college because at this time I was studying C# for the college projects.

This project I followed it on YouTube to put the knowledge I acquired to the test and to learn how to build my first project in C# using console app.

However, compared the the tutorial I did include my own changes because I wanted to understand how to create my first application and make sure that I know when to change if I wanted to change it and added moore features.

### Planned Features:

Since this project was a tutorial I found on YouTube, I don't think I would change anything. This tutorial I followed was teaching me the basics to C#. However, I could re-create this project and make it much larger using the console app and allow the user to create different styles of stories instead of fixing it on one short story. 

### What I learnt:
- Console app
- User input
- Variables
- Properties within C#
- Better understanding of Visual Studio

### Improvements:

Like I said before, if I would make improvements to this project then I would create a new console app that would allow the user to create their own story. I would also give them differnet options and unique settings to change the experience each time.

### Constraints:

I followed this project on YouTube, so I didn't have any constraints that affected the code/performance of the application.
