### Description:

This was my first ever project in C# using a console application. I learnt how to write text in the console, and I understood how to take user input and change it so that it returns it back on the screen. This project I followed it on YouTube to put my knowledge to the test and understand how a project is made.

### Planned Features:

- Console app
- User input
- Variables
- Properties within C#
- Better understanding of Visual Studio
