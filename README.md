# Madlibs-game
Funny and simple game created using C#

This was my first ever project in C# using a console application. I learnt how to use text in the console and I understood how to take user input and change it so that it returns it back on the screen. This project I followed it on YouTube to put my knowledge to the test and understand how a project is made.

I also learnt how to play around with the background colours and understand different types of properties and how the data structures work.

Because I self taught myself this meant that I had to learn how to add this project onto Github and get feedback from people in the future.

The issues I had during this project: None.

> What could I do to improve this project: I could add classes and make things neater. I could also find a way to reduce the code. For example, taking user feedback could be 5 lines of code so we could reduce it down too 3 or 2 lines of code.
